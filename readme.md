# Creative Command Deck — Silent Library Edition

The Creative Command Deck is a lightweight personal dashboard built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It provides a simple and fast way to choose your daily focus — **Learn**, **Create**, or **Research** — and then shows only the tools relevant to that mode.

The page also includes Silent Library Shelves: always-available reference links such as AI assistants, writing tools, study platforms, and general utilities.
